The first week of prework has mainly been introducing important programs, websites, and software that we will be using throughout my career as a developer. Monday I enjoyed meeting all of my fellow bootcampers. We all introduced ourselves and then went over the course material for the bootcamp, as well as the format of the classes.

The week was about what I expected. I enjoyed that we quickly dived into how developers work collaboratively together using git through the powerful site Github.

Github also proved to be my biggest struggle as I attempted to grasp the concept of the site, and how to properly utilize it in my workflow. Learning the connection between the terminal, Git and Github is also something I plan to gain a better understanding of.

As I progress through the bootcamp I look forward to connecting some of these puzzle pieces together, and climb my way out of the "Desert of Despair"

Thank you, and see you next week!
